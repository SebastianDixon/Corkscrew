# Corkscrew
Computer Science A Level NEA

Corkscrew is an A-level Coursework piece developed by Sebastian Dixon

The purpose of the software is to produce a bottleneck detecting algorithm, 
which will help the user identify specific components in their system (CPU, GPU, RAM) 
which are potentially preventing other components from performing at their intended speeds.

The CPU and GPU are benchmarked using Heaven Benchmark 4.0 and the GUI is developed using PyQt5
